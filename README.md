# WoW Classic Raid Scheduler

## Project Description

The WoW Classic Raid Scheduler is a platform dedicated to World of Warcraft Classic players, providing them with a centralized system to schedule and join raids hosted by other users. This platform aims to streamline the process of coordinating and participating in raiding activities within the game, improving the overall raiding experience for players.

## Problem Statement

World of Warcraft Classic raids require a large group of players to collaborate and overcome challenging content. Finding suitable raid groups and coordinating raid schedules can be time-consuming and often relies on external communication channels. The WoW Classic Raid Scheduler addresses these challenges by providing a dedicated platform that simplifies the scheduling and joining of raids, enhancing the overall raiding experience for players.

## Use Cases

1. **User Profile Setup**: Users can create profiles with their game details and raid preferences, enabling appropriate raid matching.
2. **Raid Creation**: Users can create new raid events, allowing other players to sign up.
3. **Event Details Update**: Users can update event details to communicate changes or important information to raid participants.
4. **Raid Search**: Users can search for raids based on specific criteria, such as availability and in-game goals.
5. **Role Selection**: Users can sign up for specific roles within raids, ensuring a balanced composition.
6. **Raid Feedback**: Users can provide feedback after completing a raid, contributing to the overall rating of the raid leader.
7. **Security and Privacy**: The platform ensures user security and privacy, allowing anonymous feedback submission.
8. **Loot Distribution**: Users can view the raid's loot distribution system (e.g., GDKP or Open Roll) to select desired raids.
9. **Raid Cancellation**: Users can delete raids in case of unforeseen circumstances.
10. **Player Approval**: Raid organizers can review the queue of players signed up for a raid and approve or reject them based on their profiles and raid requirements.

## Project Scope

The following functionalities are included in the project scope:

1. User Registration and Profile Management: Users can create and manage profiles, including game details and raid preferences.

3. Raid Search and Sign-Up: Players can search for raids based on criteria like server, raid size, or loot distribution. They can view raid details, available slots, and sign up to join raids.
4. Role Sign-Up: Users can select specific roles (e.g., tank, healer, DPS) within raid events.
5. Player Approval: Raid organizers can review the queue of players who signed up for the raid and approve or reject them based on the raid's needs.
6. Raid Feedback: Users can provide ratings and feedback after completing a raid, contributing to the organizer's overall rating.

The project will focus on delivering the above functionalities. Out-of-scope features and expansions are not included in the current design.
